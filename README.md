# CaseStudy01
Galvanize week one case study

We will be using the dataset from Kaggle for *Trending Youtube Video Statistics*.  This gives us months of data for trending videos on Youtube for many countries. 

We can see that there are 15 columns (features) involved and they are:
video_id, trending, title, channel_title, publish_time, tags, views, likes, dislikes, comment_count, thumbnail_link, comment_count, thumbnail_link, comments_disabled, ratings_disabled, video_error_or_removed, description

For simplicity and time-restraint, we only used the US dataset, but we could make a loop that will do the same analysis for all the datasets. 


Using this dataset, we want to figure out:
1. What categories do people watch the most?
2. Correlation between likes/dislikes/views/comments?
3. Is time a crucial factor?


Whether it is from a perspective of the consumer or a content creator, we want to be able to provide insights on how to successfully "use Youtube".
